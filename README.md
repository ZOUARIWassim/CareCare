# Project Archive Repository

This repository serves as a central collection point for all our project work.

We initially began our development on a different GitHub repository. However, that repository lacked proper structure and presentation, so we decided to start fresh with this one to provide a cleaner and more organized view of our work.

As a result, you will currently see only one push in this repository — it's a consolidated import of our previous work into this new, better-structured space.

> ⚠️ **Note on Data Files**  
Throughout this repository, you may notice that certain folders such as Folders for Datas (Client Data / classifications Data) are missing. This is intentional due to the **confidential nature of the dataset**. Consequently, some `.ipynb` notebook files may not function properly without these data files.  
If you are a collaborator and need access to the data, feel free to reach out — we can provide it through a secure channel if appropriate.
