# Project Archive Repository

This repository serves as a central collection point for all our project work.

We initially began our development on a different GitHub repository. However, that repository lacked proper structure and presentation, so we decided to start fresh with this one to provide a cleaner and more organized view of our work.

As a result, you will currently see only one push in this repository â€” it's a consolidated import of our previous work into this new, better-structured space.
