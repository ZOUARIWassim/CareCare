# the tokenizer.py file is used to tokenize the input text into a list of tokens
# the transformer.py file is used to define the model architecture
# the train.py file is used to train the model on the tokenized input text so you have just to run the train.py file to train the model

# the train_data is not available because of security reasons so the code is not runnable until you provide your own train_data
# the train data is a folder that contains couples (couple0 , couple 1, .....) and each couple_i contains image_i.png and label_i.txt
